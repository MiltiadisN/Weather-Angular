# Weather-Angular       
         
This is a simple weather application built with Angular. It allows users to search for weather information for a specific city and displays the temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, humidity and wind speed.          
       
## Prerequisites      
     
- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

## Getting Started        
          
Follow these steps to run the WeatherApp on your local machine:     
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.        
2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory: **npm install**
